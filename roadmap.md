# Introduction

This documentation contains the small roadmap of upcoming features that should be implemented in this project.

## Steps:

1. Make integration tests part of their own build step.
2. Create shell script file that starts docker, runs integration tests and then stops docker.
3, Create a flyway migration that creates some basic tables.
3. Create an article page: It should render the saved markdown text as html.
4. Add support in markup to write code that gets formatted.
